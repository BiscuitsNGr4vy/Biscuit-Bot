# Biscuit-Bot
I have created multiple Discord Bots that communicate with each other to execute user commands and display output to Discord. These bots were specifically created to work with The Isle (Evrima) and will not work without making some adjustments to the code for your specific host machine!

# The full project is open-source and available on my GitHub for anyone to view, use, or modify.

Making it work:
1. You must generate 4 Bot Tokens from Discord.dev.
2. Pip install any Python packages from the bots that you currently do not have.
3. You must change the file paths for each bot and scripts to tailor to your specific host machine.
4. Create a Test Environment to test the bots in a private Discord allowing them to communicate with each other and display console output directly to chat channels.
5. Set the channel IDs so the Bots know where to send output.
6. Ensure you are running 1920x1080p with a dual monitor setup for pyautogui to function correctly.


# I may re-visit this project in the future to make the conversion much more simple.
